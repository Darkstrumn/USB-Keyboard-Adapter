# USB-Keyboard-Adapter

An ATmega32u4 based keyboard controller. This was designed for use with a Psion Series 5mx keyboard, but should work for other keyboards also.

* PCB contains KiCad files for the device itself
* Firmware/Psion-Keyboard-Firmware contains an Arduino sketch for the firmware
* Firmware/ScanTheMatrix is a sketch for scanning the matrix of a keyboard. This is only meant as a tool to map a keyboard with an unknown pinout.
